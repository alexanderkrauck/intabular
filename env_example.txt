# OpenAI API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Copy this file to .env and add your actual API key

# For full AI-powered functionality (recommended):
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE

# Note: The system works without an API key using intelligent fallback mode,
# but OpenAI provides much better semantic understanding and merging strategies.
