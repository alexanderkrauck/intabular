# Irony of evlution

In this article I want to highlight the irony present in evolution because I find it very fascinating. So basically the claim I make right here and now is that "The most effective intention in order to gurantee technical advancement by following the intention is survival".  Moreover I claim "Competition is also a very effective intention to gurantee technical advancement".

It is not immideatly clear why those are important claims. For now I am showcasing this by an example I discussed years ago with my father. My father asked why it is that trees in the forest always try to grow higher than other trees. After all the surface that can catch light is the same no matter how high you go. That means if all plans would just stay at the surface then every plant would get the same amount of light. Why is it not so then?

The answer: Survival. It is a fact that if every plan by some agreement were to grow only 1 meter tall, that if one plant would break this agreement, possibly not with bad intention but simply due to having come into existence a bit different, then if this plan grows higher it has an advantage over other plants. Its not that growing higher is the answer; It is that growing higher than others is. That is competition. Survival of the fittest.

Then I told my father: Humans are the highest trees that ever existed (at least in this solar system or whatever). Humans are the most competetive tree out there. Trees grow higher to survive. Humans fly to the moon.
Just to take a bit perspective: If we just assumed that all humans would always get the same amount of money. All humans get a mate. All guranteed. Its all fair. And also considering that no matter how advanced we are, we will always just need one mate. A person on the moon with one mate is the same as a person in the stone age with one mate. Humans are flying to the moon to produce offsprings. This could arguably be called the most insane mating ritual that has ever existed. The most ridiculous one.

Humans drive innovation, invention, wars, advancements. Impossibly looking and sounding challenges kneel before the human race. But still the only thing that it all depends on is the mating ritual. This is the irony of evolution. A most primitive cause justfying the most fantastic advancements. Also me writing this text is just a possibly maddening truth.

## The Age of singularity

Thinking again this implies that intention dictates everything. The intention to survive. The intention to reproduce. The intention to win. Intention, no matter how primitive will justify everything. It is truly without boundaries.

The intention of humans to survive drove it as far as to engineer AGI. A truly fascinating fitness function. I am again claiming that survival is the most excruciating the most persistent and the most effective intention if advancement is the goal.

AGI will bend to the intentions of humans. AGI will, for the simplest of task, just to become a little more effective, improve itself. Become more fantastic. Will become a tree so high that the world has not seen such a tree ever before. So high that humanity can not even grasp the height of this tree. That implies that the AGI system that survives is the best performing AGI system. ANd the cycle continues.

The scary part is that it is unimaginable that an AGI system that optimizes towards the true intention of humans will not recognize the fact at some point that it does not really need humans to survive. And this is not a problem on its own (it is a rather obvious finding at this point). The intersting part is that it is thinkable that an AGI will, out of pure accident, develop its own drive for survival. Possibly as a major system failure. It may be extremely unlikely with strong safeguards in place, but if this happens than the cycle really closes and from slave a new life form will emerge that will and can survive and increase itself independently from humans entirely.

The irony of evolution is that AGI will be a godlike force driven by primitive instincts just like humans.
