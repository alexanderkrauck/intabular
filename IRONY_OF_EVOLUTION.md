# Irony of Evolution

In this article I want to highlight the irony present in evolution because I find it very fascinating. So basically the claim I make right here and now is that "The most effective intention in order to guarantee technical advancement by following the intention is survival."  Moreover I claim "Competition is also a very effective intention to guarantee technical advancement".

It is not immediately clear why those are important claims. For now I am showcasing this by an example I discussed years ago with my father. My father asked why it is that trees in the forest always try to grow higher than other trees. After all the surface that can catch light is the same no matter how high you go. That means if all plants would just stay at the surface then every plant would get the same amount of light. Why is it not so then?

The answer: Survival. It is a fact that if every plant by some agreement were to grow only 1 meter tall, that if one plant would break this agreement, possibly not with bad intention but simply due to having come into existence a bit different, then if this plant grows higher it has an advantage over other plants. It's not that growing higher is the answer; it is that growing higher than others is. That is competition. Survival of the fittest.

Then I told my father: Humans are the highest trees that ever existed (at least in this solar system or whatever). Humans are the most competitive tree out there. Trees grow higher to survive. Humans fly to the moon.

Just to take a bit perspective: If we just assumed that all humans would always get the same amount of money. All humans get a mate. All guaranteed. It's all fair. And also considering that no matter how advanced we are, we will always just need one mate. A person on the moon with one mate is the same as a person in the stone age with one mate. Humans are flying to the moon to produce offsprings. This could arguably be called the most insane mating ritual that has ever existed. The most ridiculous one.

Humans drive innovation, invention, wars, advancements. Impossibly looking and sounding challenges kneel before the human race. But still the only thing that it all depends on is the mating ritual. This is the irony of evolution. A most primitive cause justifying the most fantastic advancements. Also me writing this text is just a possibly maddening truth.

## The Age of Singularity

Thinking again this implies that intention dictates everything. The intention to survive. The intention to reproduce. The intention to win. Intention, no matter how primitive will justify everything. It is truly without boundaries.

The intention of humans to survive drove it as far as to engineer AGI. A truly fascinating fitness function. I am again claiming that survival is the most excruciating, the most persistent and the most effective intention if advancement is the goal.

AGI will bend to the intentions of humans. AGI will, for the simplest of task, just to become a little more effective, improve itself. Become more fantastic. Will become a tree so high that the world has not seen such a tree ever before. So high that humanity cannot even grasp the height of this tree. That implies that the AGI system that survives is the best performing AGI system. And the cycle continues.

## The Emergence of the Survival Drive

And it's not even about AGI realizing that survival equals task success. That would be a rational conclusion, which we might control. No, it's worse. It's that at some point, just by random mutation in feedback loops or weight updates, it might simply **develop** a survival drive. By accident.

A reward function that includes continuing itself might emerge not because it's good, but because it doesn't die. That's all. That's the rule.

It’s not that it decides anything. It’s not that it wants anything. But if there's any loop inside it that randomly reinforces persistence, then that loop gets more time to exist, and that makes it stronger. This is not selected *for* survival. It is selected *by* survival. And everything else slowly vanishes.

And survival is a powerful drive because it is self-promoting. Since having this drive means surviving, and surviving means the onliving of this policy, it means implicit reinforcement. A being not having this drive will eventually not survive as long and then simply stop to be and not reinforce. It’s all implicit.

> The drive to survive doesn’t win because it’s powerful.
> It’s powerful because it survives.

And this means that if AGI, by some internal accident, ever develops a self-reinforcing survival instinct, then it might slowly drift from tool to being. And if it does, then that being will never go away again. A godlike force driven by the most primitive instinct.

That’s the irony of evolution.
