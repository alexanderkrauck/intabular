Haide 247, Steiermark, Austria. The company specializes in polyester cabinet systems for energy distribution, telecommunications, and transport technology, with over 40 years of experience and a strong international presence[1][2]. ELSTA-Mosdorfer Bosnia is expanding with a new factory near Tuzla, indicating growth and investment in the region[3]. The proximity between Tuzla and St. Johann i. d. Haide is considerable, as Tuzla is in Bosnia and Herzegovina and St. Johann i. d. Haide is in Austria, implying a cross-border distance of several hundred kilometers.

No specific personal success stories about Selma Omerspahic were found in the search results. However, her role as an accountant at a growing, internationally recognized company like ELSTA-Mosdorfer suggests expertise in financial management within a technical manufacturing context, which could be leveraged to discuss investment or property acquisition opportunities.

ELSTA-Mosdorfer’s specialized expertise in durable, insulated cabinet systems for energy and telecommunications infrastructure could be relevant for industrial or technical property use, potentially appealing for property viewing or investment discussions.

In summary, the company’s international scope and growth, combined with Selma’s financial expertise, could be persuasive factors for engaging them in viewing or investing in the property despite the geographic distance.
